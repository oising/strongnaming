* v2.0.0 [2025/05/26]
  * Upgraded to net48
  * This release is NOT on nuget -- see net48 branch. After all this time, bumping the package to 2.0.0 may well wreack havoc in 10 year old CI pipelines that depend on the current version.

* v1.0.3  [2014/01/26]
  * Assembly references without a strongname will be given a  strong name using the same
    public key token as the primary target assembly.
* v1.0.2  [2013/04/30]
  * Added license and project URL.
  * Added readme.MD
* v1.0.1  [2013/04/29]
  * Updated metadata.
* v1.0.0  [2013/04/29]
  * Initial release.

About
-----
A set of PowerShell Cmdlets to facilitate signing of unsigned 3rd party assemblies with a key
of your choice, to allow them to be referenced by strongly named projects.

A NuGet package is available at: https://nuget.org/packages/Nivot.StrongNaming

Syntax
-------

All cmdlets accept pipeline input. The AssemblyFile parameter is aliased to PSPath, so it will
bind to piped files.  

* `Test-StrongName [-AssemblyFile] <string[]>  [<CommonParameters>]`

    Returns true if an assembly has a strong name.

* `Import-StrongNameKeyPair [-KeyFile] <string>  [<CommonParameters>]`
* `Import-StrongNameKeyPair [-KeyFile] <string> -Password <securestring>  [<CommonParameters>]`

    Imports a simple unprotected SNK or a password-protected PFX, returning a StrongNameKeyPair
	instance for consumption by Set-StrongName. If your PFX file has a blank password, you must
	provide a SecureString of the empty string "". SecureString instances are returned from
    the Read-Host cmdlet with the -AsSecureString parameter. For automation scenarios, use the
    ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet.

* `Set-StrongName [-AssemblyFile] <string[]> -KeyPair <StrongNameKeyPair> [-NoBackup] [-Passthru] [-Force] [-DelaySign] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]  [<CommonParameters>]`

    Assigns a strong name identity to an assembly. Any unsigned assembly references will also be
    updated to use a strong name, using the same public key token as the primary assembly. The
    referenced assemblies will need be to located and given a strong name separately.

    The `-KeyPair` parameter accepts a `System.Reflection.StrongNameKeyPair` output from the
	`Import-StrongNameKeyPair` cmdlet., which accepts either simple unprotected SNK files or
	password-protected PFX files.

    The `-NoBackup` switch directs the cmdlet to skip creating a .bak file alongside the newly
	signed assembly. 

    The `-Passthru` switch will output a `FileInfo` representing the newly signed assembly to
	the pipeline.

    The `-DelaySign` switch will create a delay-signed assembly from a public key only SNK
	(it can also create one if the SNK contains both private and public keys.) This is useful
	if you can't get access to the full private key at your company. This will allow you to
	compile against previously unsigned nuget packages at least.

    The `-Force` switch will allow you to overwrite an existing strong name on an assembly.

    NOTE: You may supply `-WhatIf` to see what _would_ be done, without actually doing it.

*  `Get-AssemblyName [-AssemblyFile] <string[]>  [<CommonParameters>]`

    Returns a `System.Reflection.AssemblyName` instance from any assembly file.
    
FAQ: How Do I?
--------------

### Get the default package root folder
    PM> $root = join-path (split-path $dte.solution.filename) packages

### Load an unprotected snk 
    PM> $key = Import-StrongNameKeyPair -KeyFile .\folder\key.snk
    PM> dir *.dll | Set-StrongName -KeyPair $key -Verbose

### Load a password-protected PFX
    PM> $key = Import-StrongNameKeyPair -KeyFile .\folder\key.pfx -Password (Read-Host -AsSecureString)
    ******

### Sign some unsigned assemblies
    PM> cd (join-path $root unsignedPackage)
    PM> dir -rec *.dll | set-strongname -keypair $key -verbose

### (Re)sign some assemblies forcefully
    PM> dir -rec *.dll | set-strongname -keypair $key -force

### Sign only unsigned assemblies 
    PM> dir -rec *.dll | where { -not (test-strongname $_.fullname) } | set-strongname -keypair $key -verbose
